    <h3 class="italic colorred"> What is CSS?</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in other media</li>
        <li> <b style="text-decoration: line-through;"> Css is not neccesary</b> <b style="background-color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">CSS saves a lot of work. </b>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;" class="italic">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="italic colorred">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section </li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However, 
            <b style="background-color: yellow;"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b>
                because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.
        ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.
        ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to directly to an element and its used by JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
        In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once and element has been targeted, a style or a set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used totarget elements to which a style should be applied.
